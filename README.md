# Retail_forecsts_project
This project is a personal exercise focused on kaggle data. Starting from raw data collection to advanced time series forecasting. The primary goal was to practice data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modeling using Python.

Data Cleaning: 
Handled missing values, optimized data types, and performed feature engineering (Date/Time features).

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
Definition of KPI and analysis of sales distribution and identified transaction outliers.
Investigated customer demographics and product category performance.
Calculated key metrics like average price per transaction and revenue volatility.

Time Series & Forecasting:
Created a monthly revenue series.
Tested stationarity via ADF Test and implemented an ARIMA(1, 1, 1) model.
Trained and tested the model.
Made forecasts for the six months ahead.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Kagglehub.
